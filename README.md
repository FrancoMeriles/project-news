# Project News - The Hound News

This project is an example of how to use vanilla javascript to build an application that consumes a service, in this case i am using the [News Api](https://newsapi.org/) and i am also using this [Boilerplate](https://github.com/shaminmeerankutty/webpack-sass-bootstrap-boilerplate) where i am a contributor.

In this project i play arround a lot with:

- Vanilla Javascript ES6
- Classes
- Promises

## Design

The UI/UX is made by [Sof√≠a Colque](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofiacolquesaavedra/), thanks a lot.
